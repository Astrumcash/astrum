I have seen so many people having issues with installing the linux version that i decided to list setup a guide.
This is also due to some errors I found while installing mine, so this should make it easier for everyone!

I have included some extras that help bypass some of the issues and are not mentioned as dependencies on the documentation.

sudo apt-get install build-essential libtool autotools-dev automake pkg-config libssl-dev libevent-dev bsdmainutils

On at least Ubuntu 14.04+ and Debian 7+ there are generic names for the individual boost development packages, so the following can be used to only install necessary parts of boost:

sudo apt-get install libboost-system-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-chrono-dev libboost-program-options-dev libboost-test-dev libboost-thread-dev

These are the dependencies listed on Astrum repo

Dependency Build Instructions: Ubuntu & Debian
----------------------------------------------
sudo apt-get install build-essential
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
sudo apt-get install libdb++-dev
sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev
sudo apt-get install libqrencode-dev

Thia is a must to avoid errors

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:bitcoin/bitcoin
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libdb4.8-dev libdb4.8++-dev

sudo apt-get install libminiupnpc-dev
sudo apt-get install libzmq3-dev

git clone https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1.git

cd /secp256k1
$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure
$ make
$ ./tests
$ sudo make install  # optional

git clone https://github.com/Astrumcash/astrum.git
cd /astrum/src
make -f makefile.unix

you will probably get an error saying:

/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lgmp

 to fix this run:
 
 sudo apt-get install libgmp3-dev
 
 After this run:
 make -f makefile.unix
 
 all should be installed and you can start your daemon
 
 ./Astrum -daemon
